# (*Whole New World* with a twist) For CSE 30
Student to tutor:
I can show you my code
Concise, indented, Commented
Tell me, tutor, now when did
You last see neat code like this? 
I can open your eyes 
Talk about my code line by line. 
I checked the guideline again and again
Now I’m feeling fine
A whole new world
C program is so low level
Compiler just tells you no
With segmentation fault
I miss JVM
A whole new world
Assembly can be real pain in the ass
But when your code compiles
It feels surreal 
And now you need to check all the test cases (Now it’s the most difficult)
Unbelievable bugs
Make you wanna just give up
Looping, breaking, and now you are sweating
You start to blame PAs
A whole new world (Don't you dare drop the class)
You have to use your gdb!! (Hold your breath, it gets better)
I put into so much time
I've come so far
I need this class to take upper CSE
A whole new world (Every PA is a surprise)
The weight of PA gets heavier (Every time I check my grade, I panick)
I'll put a ticket in Autograder
There's a two-hour line
Now I know why start early start often
A whole new world (A whole new world)
C is amazing (Though I’m suffering)
Assembly is a lot
I just wanna get A
For CSE 30

lol I really enjoy writing this. Maybe I will write another one for getting into CSE major?... Part of Your World?
Pray for all the kids who are taking CSE30 next quarter. I'm excited to tutor y'all and learn along the way
